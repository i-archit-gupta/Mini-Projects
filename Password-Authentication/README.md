# Password Authentication using Python
This simple Python script provides a basic password authentication mechanism. Users are prompted to enter their username and password, and the script checks the provided credentials against a predefined dictionary (db). The password is hidden using the getpass module for enhanced security.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or copy the script into your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-authentication-python.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd password-authentication-python
```
3. Run the script:

```bash
python authenticate.py
```
4. Follow the prompts to enter your username and password. If the credentials are correct, the script will print "Verified."

## Customization
1. Add More Users:

    - You can add more usernames and passwords to the db dictionary.
2. Integrate with Your System:
   - Modify the script to integrate with your authentication system or use it as a starting point for more advanced applications.
3. Enhance Security:

    - Implement additional security measures such as hashing and salting for improved password protection.
