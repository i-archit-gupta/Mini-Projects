# Web Scraper using Python

This Python script utilizes the BeautifulSoup library to perform web scraping on a Wikipedia page that compares programming languages. The script extracts data from an HTML table, saves it as a CSV file (`language.csv`), and then converts it into an Excel file (`language.xlsx`). Below is a brief overview of the libraries used:

## Libraries Used

### 1. BeautifulSoup

- **Purpose:** BeautifulSoup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It provides a convenient way to navigate, search, and modify the parse tree.
- **Installation:** You can install it using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install beautifulsoup4
  ```

### 2. urllib

- **Purpose:** The `urlopen` function from the `urllib.request` module is used to open URLs and fetch the HTML content of a web page.
- **Installation:** It is part of the Python standard library, so no additional installation is required.

### 3. csv

- **Purpose:** The `csv` module is used for reading from and writing to CSV files. It simplifies the process of handling CSV data.
- **Installation:** It is part of the Python standard library, so no additional installation is required.

### 4. openpyxl

- **Purpose:** Openpyxl is a Python library for reading and writing Excel (xlsx) files. It allows for easy manipulation of Excel data.
- **Installation:** You can install it using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install openpyxl
  ```

### 5. pandas

- **Purpose:** Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library. In this script, it is used to read data from the CSV file and save it as an Excel file.
- **Installation:** You can install it using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas
  ```

## Usage

1. Ensure that the required libraries are installed using the provided installation commands.

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```

3. Check the generated files: `language.csv` and `language.xlsx` in the project directory.

## Customization
### 1. Change URL:

- Modify the URL in the urlopen function to scrape data from a different webpage.
### 2. Enhance Data Processing:

- Customize the script to process the extracted data further based on your requirements.
